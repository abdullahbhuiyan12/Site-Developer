        <h1> Here is some interesting sotry that people could like to read. </h1>
        <p>In the early 1950s, while working at the Harvard University Computation Laboratory, Hopper developed the first compiler, which allowed programmers to write programs in English-like statements that could be translated into machine code. This innovation made programming more accessible and helped to pave the way for the development of high-level programming languages like COBOL.

            Hopper went on to work on a number of other important projects, including the development of the UNIVAC I computer, which was the first commercial computer in the United States. She also played a key role in the development of the first programming language for business applications, COBOL, which is still widely used today.
            
            But perhaps one of Hopper's most famous contributions to computer science is the concept of a "debugger". Legend has it that while working on the Mark II computer, Hopper discovered that a moth had gotten stuck in one of the machine's relays, causing a malfunction. She reportedly removed the insect and taped it to the machine's logbook with the notation "first actual case of bug being found". The term "debugging" has been used ever since to refer to the process of finding and fixing errors in computer code.
            
            Hopper's work had a profound impact on the development of computer science and technology, and she continues to be celebrated as a trailblazer and innovator in the field. Her legacy serves as an inspiration to many, particularly to women and other underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and her contributions have helped to shape the way we live and work in the digital age..</p>
